	<h1>Test Information</h1>
		<body>Mycoplasma is a prokaryotic organism, often found to be contaminating cell cultures. It is essential that all new cell cultures should be tested  for the presence of Mycoplasma. Here, we use Mycosensor PCR Assay Kit (Agilent Technologies, Catalog #302109). Test results will be sent within 3 weeks from the date received. The standard cost of the test is £50?/sample and any additional costs will be added to the invoice. 
		</body>
	<h2>Test Procedure</h2>
	<body>
	We use the Mycosensor PCR Assay Kit (Agilent Technologies, Catalog #302109), which detects eight Mycoplasma and Acholeplasma species, the main agents of tissue culture infection. They include: 

	M. arginini				
	M. fermentas				
	M. hominis
	M. hyorhinis
 	M. pirum
	M. salivarium
	M. orale
	A. laidlawi

The cultures must have been grown without any antibiotics for either three subcultures or for 2 weeks (whichever is greater). To prepare the sample, we boil the extract of cell culture cells, rather than the supernatant to provide cell-equivalent standardisation allowing us to detect weak or cell-growth-inhibiting Mycoplasma infections. 

We then carry out polymerase chain reaction (PCR) which will detect any of the aforementioned eight species using specific primers. If the test cell line is infected with Mycoplasma, the Mycoplasma primer mix will selectively amplify a given region of the genome (16S rRNA). 

We use a 2% gel electrophoresis that will identify the presence of any mycoplasma infection by the presence of a single 315-bp band. This will run along with positive, negative, and an internal template control which will validate the test. 

If the test results are vague, additional tests will be carried out. This includes  using an agar and broth culture method and/or indirect staining method depending on circumstances. You will be notified via email once the results are available on the database on our website.

	<h2>Why is Mycoplasma testing essential?</h2>
	<body>
	The incidence of single mycoplasma contamination is 15 to 35% worldwide with extreme incidences of 65 to 80% ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3584481/ ). Therefore testing for its presence is a major part of sample quality control as its presence can alter aspects of cell physiology, therefore disqualifying these experiments. Because of its spread to all the cultures within a laboratory, it is essential to regularly check cell cultures for Mycoplasma infection.

	<h1>Sample Testing - Sending the Sample In:</h1>
	<body>
 
	There are 5 simple steps that you need to follow in order for us to deliver the excellent service.	
	Email us with your details and receive a sample form immediately. 
	Label the sample
	Proper sample preparation
	Storage/transportation of sample
	Notification of Technical Service
	Sample submission form: Before sending the sample, enclose a sample submission form.
	Label the sample: Clearly label the sample and make sure that the identification number on the sample submission form corresponds exactly with the identification number on the sample submitted.
	NB. Our Laboratories is a Biosafety Level 2 (BSL 2) facility and does not accept test materials that exceed BSL 2 handling and requirements. Please contact Technical Services to verify acceptance of your sample prior to shipping any sample containing human or animal viruses, potential pathogens or other biohazardous materials.
 
	Proper sample preparation: Our laboratories recommends freezing samples without cryopreservatives and storing samples at ≤ - 60°C. In addition, cell culture samples should be cultured in antibiotic-free media for at least three passages prior to submission. If not, we are able to this, however the time period will significantly increase. Samples should be shipped overnight with sufficient dry ice to maintain sample integrity for optimal detection of mycoplasma.
 
 
	Shipping: Ship sample(s) at our laboratories, Monday - Friday, 8:00 am - 4:00 pm. Shipping Address:
	UCL diagnostics,
	43 Gower Street,
	London WC1E 6BT
	United Kingdom
 
	If you have any questions about sample preparation and/or shipping, please contact us at +44 20 7679 2123.
 
	NB. Please notify us 2 business days prior to shipping the samples.  Information can be forwarded either by faxing your sample submission form to +44 20 7679 2123 or e-mailing to ucldiagnostics@ucl.ac.uk </body>

	<h2>Treating positive samples</h2>
	<body>
	Samples that have tested positive for Mycoplasma should ideally not be used as even a small amount of contamination can affect the experiments adversely. A new sample should be obtained from an uncontaminated stock. In cases where the stock is contaminated, not possible to remake or the sample is difficult to obtain or expensive, the sample can be treated with antibiotics and other compounds to eliminate the infection. 

	Antibiotics from the tetracycline, macrolide and quinolone families can block the Mycoplasma’s protein synthesis by interfering with the ribosomal machinery. 
	Individual antibiotics available today include: AbD Serotec’s Mycoplasma Removal Agent; AppliChem’s Myco-1, Myco-2 and Myco-3; and PromoKine’s BIOMYC-1, BIOMYC-2 and BIOMYC-3 
	Reference: (http://www.biocompare.com/	Editorial-Articles/170554-Clean-Your-Cultures-with-These-Mycoplasma-Elimination-Tools/) 
	The use of two antibiotics in combination is recommended to ensure the eradication of the infection. Examples of double-antibiotic remedies include: Genlantis’ MycoGONE Mycoplasma Antibiotics Cocktail; InvivoGen’s Plasmocin™ and Plasmocure™; and Roche’s BM-Cyclin. However this can be time consuming, and an alternate approach is the use of an antibody with a reagent that kills Mycoplasma directly. These are two-step treatments: Step one is the reagent, which kills most of the mycoplasma in a few hours or less, followed by the antibiotic, which kills the remaining mycoplasma (this usually takes up to two weeks). Combination remedies include AppliChem’s Myco-4, Minerva Biolabs’ Mynox® Gold, PromoKine’s Mycoplasma-EXand Sigma-Aldrich’s LookOut® Mycoplasma Elimination Kit.
